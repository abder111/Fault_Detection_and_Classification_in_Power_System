Power Grid Monitoring System
===========================
This project addresses a critical need in modern electrical infrastructure - automatically detecting and identifying faults in power distribution networks. When abnormalities occur in voltage or current signals, they can lead to equipment damage, power outages, or safety hazards if not quickly identified and addressed.

Project Importance
==================
Electrical faults come in different types (short circuits, line failures, etc.), each requiring specific responses. Traditional monitoring systems often require manual analysis by trained engineers. Our solution provides:

* Automatic real-time detection of power anomalies
* Instant classification of fault types
* Visual timeline of grid health
* Early warning before small issues become major failures

Data Source
===========
The system was developed using realistic simulation data from MATLAB Simulink, which accurately models:

* Three-phase power transmission lines
* Various fault scenarios (LG, LLG, LL, etc.)
* Normal operating conditions with natural fluctuations

The simulated data includes:
- Voltage measurements (Va, Vb, Vc)
- Current measurements (Ia, Ib, Ic)
- Precise timestamps of fault occurrences

Practical Applications
=====================
This technology helps:

1. **Utility Companies**:
   - Reduce outage times through faster fault identification
   - Prioritize maintenance crews based on fault severity

2. **Industrial Facilities**:
   - Protect sensitive equipment from power disturbances
   - Maintain production line reliability

3. **Smart Grid Development**:
   - Enable self-healing power networks
   - Provide data for infrastructure upgrades
